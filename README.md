# Spotify Project
### A group project with the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (December 2021)

 - The aim of this project was to collect data and perform an EDA, presenting the results as a group
 - The chosen category for this project was the most steamed songs on the Spotify platform

### Collating the Data

The final file was created using the spotify API to pull two dataframes:

 - [Track information](https://github.com/Amina-H1/spotify-project/blob/main/tracks.csv), pulled from a Spotify playlist of the top 100 streamed songs. This contains basic track information, such as artist/album name and release dates.
 - [Audio features](https://github.com/Amina-H1/spotify-project/blob/main/features.csv), pulled from the API's audio features function. This covers a wide range of information created using Spotify's own algorithms, such as danceability, acousticness, energy and valence

Finally, the number of streams was collected from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-streamed_songs_on_Spotify).
